F13-Lab Evaluation 3
Part 1: Teachers' Interface

The Teachers’ Interface allows teachers to schedule and confirm assignments or tests using a calendar widget.

A task can only be scheduled if the subject’s period is available on that day.

Only one task per day is allowed for student convenience.

If a task already exists for the selected date, a message box notifies the teacher.

All scheduled tasks are saved in a CSV file named test_schedule.csv, which is later accessed by the Students’ Interface.

Part 2: Students' Interface

The Students’ Interface functions as a task manager, helping students keep track of assignments and personal activities.

Students can log activities or add future tasks using an entry box.

All logs are saved in a file and displayed in a listbox for easy viewing.

Selecting a date on the calendar shows the task scheduled for that day.

Assignments scheduled by teachers (from test_schedule.csv) are also displayed in the listbox alongside personal tasks.
